                        <p class="fs-5">1.Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies,
                            providing much
                            greater storage capacity. If you look at the Mozilla source code we can see that 5120KB (5MB
                            which equals 2.5 Million chars on Chrome) is the default storage size for an entire domain.
                            This gives you considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5">2.The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images,
                            JavaScript,
                            CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of traffic between client and server.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5">3.The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes
                            made are saved
                            and available for all current and future visits to the site.</p>
                        <h4 class="text-danger">Session Storage</h4>
                        <p class="fs-5">1.It is similar to localStorage.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5">2.The data is not persistent i.e. data is only available per window (or tab in
                            browsers like
                            Chrome and Firefox). Data is only available during the page session. Changes made are saved
                            and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same
                            tab/window. Once the tab/window is closed, the data is deleted.</p>
